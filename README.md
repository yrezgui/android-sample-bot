# Android Sample Bot

The goal of this bot is to run checks on existing samples and new PRs created on [https://github.com/android](https://github.com/android/) to maintain a quality standard across Android materials for developers.

Currently this bot checks if a sample is registered in a list used by Android Studio to import them.

Soon, it will run other checks to simplify reviews on the samples and engage the developer community to contribute to them
